# Problem Definition & Analysis

## Current State Analysis

### Developer Pain Points in Large Organizations

#### 1. Context Switching Overhead
- **Problem**: Developers spend 20-30% of their time searching for information across multiple systems
- **Impact**: Reduced productivity, increased cognitive load
- **Current Solutions**: Manual bookmarking, tribal knowledge, outdated wikis

#### 2. Knowledge Fragmentation
- **Systems involved**: 
  - Code repositories (GitHub, GitLab, internal Git)
  - Project management (Jira, Azure DevOps, Linear)
  - Documentation (Confluence, SharePoint, Notion, internal wikis)
  - Communication (Teams, Slack, Discord)
  - Architecture decisions (ADRs, RFCs scattered across repos)

#### 3. AI Assistant Limitations
- **Problem**: Current AI assistants lack organizational context
- **Examples**:
  - GitHub Copilot suggests deprecated patterns
  - ChatGPT doesn't know internal architectural decisions
  - Claude can't access current project constraints
  
#### 4. Documentation Decay
- **Problem**: Information becomes stale without clear ownership
- **Impact**: AI and developers use outdated information
- **Examples**: Deprecated APIs still documented, old patterns recommended

## User Personas

### Primary: Senior Developer in Large Org
- **Daily workflow**: Multiple repos, complex integrations, mentoring others
- **Pain points**: Finding relevant examples, understanding system relationships
- **Goals**: Write consistent code, make informed technical decisions
- **Tools**: IDE with AI, GitHub, Jira, internal docs

### Secondary: Tech Lead / Architect
- **Daily workflow**: Design reviews, technical debt management, cross-team coordination
- **Pain points**: Ensuring consistency across teams, knowledge transfer
- **Goals**: Maintain architectural coherence, enable team autonomy
- **Tools**: Architecture tools, documentation platforms, project management

### Tertiary: New Team Member
- **Daily workflow**: Learning codebase, understanding context, asking questions
- **Pain points**: Information overload, outdated documentation, unclear patterns
- **Goals**: Become productive quickly, avoid common mistakes
- **Tools**: IDE, documentation, mentorship, learning resources

## Problem Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Story Implementation
**Context**: Developer receives Jira story for new feature

**Current State**:
1. Read Jira story (lacks technical context)
2. Search for related code (manual, time-consuming)
3. Find relevant documentation (often outdated)
4. Ask team members for context (interruptions)
5. Make assumptions based on incomplete information

**Desired State**:
1. AI assistant automatically provides:
   - Related existing implementations
   - Relevant architectural decisions
   - Current best practices for this service
   - Testing patterns and examples
   - Known gotchas and constraints

### Scenario 2: Code Review
**Context**: Reviewing PR from another team member

**Current State**:
1. Review code without full context
2. Check if patterns align with team standards (manual)
3. Verify against architectural decisions (if remembered)
4. May miss inconsistencies with other parts of system

**Desired State**:
1. AI highlights:
   - Deviations from established patterns
   - Impact on related components
   - Relevant architectural constraints
   - Testing coverage recommendations

### Scenario 3: Technical Decision Making
**Context**: Choosing technology/approach for new component

**Current State**:
1. Research options independently
2. Search for existing usage in org (incomplete)
3. Find relevant ADRs/RFCs (if they exist and are findable)
4. Make decision with limited context

**Desired State**:
1. AI provides:
   - Similar decisions made in the past
   - Current technology preferences in org
   - Relevant architectural constraints
   - Examples of successful implementations

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Time to find relevant information (target: 80% reduction)
- Code consistency scores across teams
- Time from story assignment to first commit
- Number of questions in team channels about "where to find X"

### Qualitative
- Developer satisfaction with information availability
- AI assistant helpfulness ratings
- Code review quality improvements
- New team member onboarding experience

## Constraints & Requirements

### Technical Constraints
- **Privacy**: All data must remain local/on-premise
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for queries
- **Integration**: Must work with existing developer tools
- **Maintenance**: Low operational overhead

### Organizational Constraints
- **Adoption**: Must provide immediate value to encourage usage
- **Governance**: Respect existing access controls
- **Change Management**: Minimal disruption to current workflows
- **Cost**: Leverage existing infrastructure where possible

### User Experience Constraints
- **Learning Curve**: Minimal additional tools/interfaces
- **Reliability**: High availability during business hours
- **Relevance**: Results must be contextually appropriate
- **Trust**: Transparent about information sources and freshness

## Research Questions

1. **Architecture**: Graph DB vs Vector DB vs Hybrid approach?
2. **Integration**: MCP vs Custom APIs vs Direct tool integration?
3. **Indexing**: Real-time vs Batch vs Hybrid update strategies?
4. **Scope**: Single repo vs Multi-repo vs Organization-wide?
5. **Privacy**: How to balance utility with sensitive information?
6. **Maintenance**: How to keep information fresh without manual overhead?

## Next Steps for Research

1. **Competitive Analysis**: Research existing solutions (see EXISTING_SOLUTIONS.md)
2. **Technical Feasibility**: Prototype key components
3. **User Validation**: Interview potential users about pain points
4. **Architecture Decision**: Create decision matrix for key choices
5. **Scope Definition**: Define MVP boundaries based on user feedback
