# MCP Knowledge Index: Context Engineering for AI Assistants

A **Context Engineering platform** that transforms generic AI assistants into organization-aware development partners by providing rich, relevant contextual information from your codebase, project management systems, and team communications.

## The Context Engineering Vision

**Context Engineering** is the systematic design, collection, and delivery of relevant contextual information to AI systems to improve their decision-making quality in specific domains.

Instead of AI suggesting generic solutions, our system provides:
- 🏗️ **Organizational Patterns**: Your team's actual coding patterns and architectural decisions
- 🔗 **Cross-File Dependencies**: Complete impact analysis when making changes  
- 📋 **Project Context**: Current Jira stories, team discussions, and business requirements
- 🕐 **Historical Context**: Past decisions, lessons learned, and evolution patterns
- 🚫 **Constraint Awareness**: What NOT to do based on your specific environment

## Key Problem: AI "Forgets" Cross-File Dependencies

Example scenario that our system solves:
```
❌ Current AI Behavior:
Developer: "Rename this property from 'email' to 'emailAddress'"
AI: [Changes only current file] ✅ Done!
Result: 🔥 Breaks 7 other files, tests fail, deployment fails

✅ With Context Engineering:
Developer: "Rename this property from 'email' to 'emailAddress'" 
AI: "This affects 7 files:
  - User.java:23 (@Column annotation)
  - application.yml:67 (validation key)
  - user-requests.http:8 (test request)
  [+ 4 more files]
  
  Should I prepare a complete changeset?"
Result: ✅ All related files updated correctly
```
