# Research: Implement GitHub Projects/Issues/Milestones Management

## GitHub API Authentication Methods

**Decision**: Use Personal Access Tokens (PAT) for server-side authentication
**Rationale**: PATs provide fine-grained permissions, are stable for server applications, and integrate well with existing token-based auth patterns in ContextFlow
**Alternatives considered**:
- OAuth App: Too complex for server-side data collection, requires user interaction
- GitHub App: Overkill for read-only data collection, adds installation complexity

## PyGitHub Library Evaluation

**Decision**: Use PyGitHub library for GitHub API interactions
**Rationale**: Mature Python library with comprehensive API coverage, good documentation, active maintenance, and handles rate limiting automatically
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct REST API calls: Would require manual pagination, rate limiting, error handling
- Other libraries (github3.py): Less active maintenance compared to PyGitHub

## GitHub API Rate Limit Handling

**Decision**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter for rate limit handling
**Rationale**: GitHub allows 5000 requests/hour for authenticated users, exponential backoff prevents thundering herd, jitter reduces collision probability
**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed retry delays: Less efficient, higher collision risk
- No retry: Would fail on rate limits, poor user experience

## Neo4j Schema Design for GitHub Entities

**Decision**: Use labeled nodes with relationship properties for GitHub data
**Rationale**: Allows flexible querying of issue-project-milestone relationships, supports C4 model integration, enables graph traversals for dependency analysis
**Schema**:
```
(:GitHubRepository {id, name, full_name})
(:GitHubIssue {id, title, state, created_at})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:GitHubRepository)
(:GitHubProject {id, name, state})-[:HOSTED_IN]->(:GitHubRepository)
(:GitHubMilestone {id, title, due_on})-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:GitHubRepository)
(:GitHubIssue)-[:ASSIGNED_TO {column}]->(:GitHubProject)
(:GitHubIssue)-[:TARGETS]->(:GitHubMilestone)
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- Relational tables: Would require complex joins for graph-like queries
- Document storage: Less efficient for relationship-heavy queries
