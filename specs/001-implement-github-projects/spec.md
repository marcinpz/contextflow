# Feature Specification: Implement GitHub Projects/Issues/Milestones Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-github-projects`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Implement GitHub Projects/Issues/Milestones management"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using ContextFlow, I want the system to collect and provide GitHub project management data (issues, projects, milestones) so that AI assistants can understand project context and dependencies when making code changes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a GitHub repository with open issues, **When** ContextFlow indexes the repository, **Then** AI assistants can query for issue details and relationships.
2. **Given** a GitHub project board with milestones, **When** ContextFlow processes the project, **Then** the system provides milestone progress and deadline information to AI assistants.
3. **Given** an issue with cross-references to code, **When** AI assistant needs context, **Then** it receives both issue details and related code changes.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GitHub API rate limits are exceeded?
- How does system handle private repositories without access tokens?
- What happens when issues are updated after initial indexing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch GitHub issues from configured repositories
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch GitHub projects and project boards
- **FR-003**: System MUST fetch GitHub milestones and their associated issues
- **FR-004**: System MUST store GitHub data in Neo4j graph with proper relationships
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide GitHub data via MCP tools for AI assistants
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle GitHub API authentication [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: token-based or OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST update GitHub data periodically to reflect changes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **GitHubIssue**: Represents a GitHub issue with title, description, status, labels, assignees
- **GitHubProject**: Represents a GitHub project board with columns and items
- **GitHubMilestone**: Represents a milestone with title, description, due date, completion status
- **GitHubRepository**: Represents a repository with issues, projects, milestones
