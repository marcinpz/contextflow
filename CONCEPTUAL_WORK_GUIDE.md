# Conceptual Work & Research Guide

## How to Approach Conceptual Work

This guide shows how to systematically work on the ContextFlow concept before moving to implementation.

## Key Documents to Read

### 1. **CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md** - Main Concept
- What is Context Engineering and why is it crucial?
- How does it differ from regular knowledge management?
- Specific examples of value proposition

### 2. **PROBLEM_DEFINITION.md** - Understand the Problem
- What are the pain points of developers in large organizations?
- Who are our users and what do they need?
- What scenarios must we handle?

### 3. **CROSS_FILE_DEPENDENCIES.md** - Specific Example
- Why does AI often "forget" about related files?
- Examples: Controller → Properties → HTTP files
- How does this affect developer productivity?

### 4. **CONTEXT_OPTIMIZATION.md** - Context Bloat Problem
- Why do AI agents get slower over time?
- Context compacting and context loss
- Context optimization strategies

### 5. **ASSUMPTION_INVALIDATION.md** - When Assumptions Change
- REST API → Pub/Sub during implementation
- Cascade effect and orphaned code problem
- Assumption tracking and change impact analysis

### 6. **COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md** - What Already Exists
- Sourcegraph, GitHub Copilot, Backstage...
- Where are the gaps in existing solutions?
- What do we do differently/better?

### 7. **ARCHITECTURE_OPTIONS.md** - How to Build It
- 4 different architectural approaches
- Pros and cons of each
- Recommended development path

## Practical Steps for Conceptual Work

### Week 1-2: Deep Problem Analysis
```bash
# Read documents
cat research/problem-analysis/PROBLEM_DEFINITION.md
cat research/problem-analysis/CROSS_FILE_DEPENDENCIES.md

# Reflect on your own experiences:
# - When did AI "break" your code with incomplete changes?
# - How much time do you spend searching for related files?
# - What are your biggest pain points?
```

### Week 2-3: Researching Competitive Solutions
```bash
# Try existing tools:
# 1. Sourcegraph (trial) - code search
# 2. GitHub Copilot - AI assistance
# 3. Cursor - AI IDE
# 4. Backstage - developer portal

# Document:
# - What works well?
# - Where are the gaps?
# - What could we do better?
```

### Week 3-4: Conceptual Prototypes
```bash
# Create simple prototypes in research/experiments/
mkdir -p research/experiments

# Examples:
# - Simple Java parser → finding @Value("${...}")
# - Pattern search in .http files
# - Property mapping between application.yml and code
```

## Key Questions to Resolve

### 1. Architecture
- **Graph DB vs Vector DB vs Hybrid?**
  - Neo4j for structural relationships?
  - Qdrant for semantic search?
  - Do we need both?

### 2. AI Integration
- **MCP vs Custom API vs Direct integration?**
  - How to best "inject" context into AI?
  - Which AI assistants to support first?

### 3. Project Scope
- **Single repo vs Multi-repo vs Organization-wide?**
  - What to focus on in MVP?
  - How to scale later?

### 4. Privacy vs Functionality
- **Fully local vs Hybrid vs Cloud?**
  - How to maintain privacy in large organizations?
  - What data can be indexed?

## Tools for Experimentation

### Simple Conceptual Tests
```bash
# Test parsing Java files
find . -name "*.java" -exec grep -l "@Value" {} \;

# Test finding property relationships
grep -r "app\.feature\.enabled" . --include="*.java" --include="*.yml" --include="*.properties"

# Test patterns in HTTP files
find . -name "*.http" -exec grep -l "POST.*api" {} \;
```

### Tree-sitter Prototypes
```bash
# Install tree-sitter Python bindings
pip install tree-sitter tree-sitter-java tree-sitter-yaml

# Experiment with parsing
cd research/experiments
python tree_sitter_test.py
```

### Database Tests
```bash
# Neo4j local (Docker)
docker run --name neo4j-test -p 7687:7687 -p 7474:7474 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password neo4j

# Qdrant local (Docker)
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant

# SQLite - no setup needed
sqlite3 test_dependencies.db
```

## Documenting Decisions

For each important decision, create an ADR (Architecture Decision Record):

```bash
mkdir -p docs/decisions
# Use format: docs/decisions/001-database-choice.md
```

Example ADR structure:
```markdown
# ADR-001: Database Choice for Dependency Storage

## Context
[Description of situation and options]

## Decision
[Decision made]

## Rationale
[Justification]

## Consequences
[Expected consequences]
```

## Concept Validation

### With Potential Users
- **Developer interviews** - is the problem real?
- **Prototype demo** - does the solution make sense?
- **MVP feedback** - what is most important?

### Technical Validation
- **Performance tests** - does it scale to large repositories?
- **Accuracy tests** - is dependency detection accurate?
- **Integration tests** - does MCP integration work?

## Next Steps

After completing conceptual work:

1. **Finalize architecture** - choose specific approach
2. **Define MVP scope** - what we do in first version
3. **Create implementation plan** - roadmap for next months
4. **Start prototyping** - first working code

**Remember**: Better to spend 2-3 weeks on solid conceptual analysis than 2-3 months implementing the wrong solution. This stage is crucial for the success of the entire project.
