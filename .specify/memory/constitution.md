# ContextFlow Constitution

## Core Principles

### Context Engineering First
All development decisions must prioritize context collection, optimization, and delivery to AI systems. Context bloat must be prevented through dynamic optimization. Rationale: Ensures AI assistants receive relevant, high-quality context without performance degradation.

### Privacy-First Architecture
All data processing occurs locally with complete organizational control. No external data transmission without explicit consent. Rationale: Protects organizational data sovereignty and maintains trust in the platform.

### Integration-Centric Design
Unified interfaces for all external sources (Jira, Slack, Email, Code). Consistent API patterns and error handling. Rationale: Simplifies maintenance and ensures reliable data flow from diverse sources.

### Performance-Optimized
Context delivery must be sub-2 seconds. 60-70% context reduction through intelligent optimization. Rationale: Critical for AI assistant responsiveness and user productivity.

### AI-Agnostic Compatibility
Compatible with all major AI assistants via MCP protocol. No vendor lock-in. Rationale: Ensures broad adoption and future-proofs the platform against AI ecosystem changes.

## Security Requirements

Data encryption at rest, secure authentication for integrations, privacy filtering, audit logging. Rationale: Protects sensitive organizational data and ensures compliance with security standards.

## Development Workflow

Test-first development, code reviews for context impact, integration testing for all changes, documentation updates. Rationale: Maintains code quality and ensures features work correctly in the integrated system.

## Governance
Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan. All PRs must verify compliance. Use AGENTS.md for runtime guidance. Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for incompatible changes, MINOR for new features, PATCH for fixes.
