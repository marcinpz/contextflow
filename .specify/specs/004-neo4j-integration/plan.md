# Implementation Plan: Neo4j Integration for Knowledge Graph

**Branch**: `004-neo4j-integration` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: .specify/specs/004-neo4j-integration/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-neo4j-integration/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement local Neo4j setup for ContextFlow knowledge graph, enabling C4 modeling with nodes for Context, Container, Component, and Code entities, and relationships between them.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: neo4j-driver, docker (for Neo4j)  
**Storage**: Neo4j Community Edition  
**Testing**: pytest  
**Target Platform**: Linux (local development)  
**Project Type**: single (Python library/service)  
**Performance Goals**: Fast local queries for development  
**Constraints**: Local installation, no cloud dependencies  
**Scale/Scope**: Development-scale graph (thousands of nodes)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on AGENTS.md guidelines: Python 3.11+, type hints required, follow MCP protocol patterns.

**Structure Decision**: Single Python project structure with separate neo4j_integration module.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Neo4j Community Edition installation process
   - Python neo4j-driver best practices
   - C4 modeling in graph databases

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Neo4j Community Edition installation for local development"
   Task: "Find best practices for Python neo4j-driver usage"
   Task: "Research C4 architecture modeling in Neo4j"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all unknowns resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Context: name, description
   - Container: name, belongs_to Context
   - Component: name, belongs_to Container
   - Code: name, belongs_to Component

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - install_neo4j() → bool
   - create_schema() → void
   - connect_to_neo4j() → Neo4jClient

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test Neo4j installation
   - Test schema creation
   - Test connection establishment

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Setup Neo4j locally
   - Create C4 schema
   - Query relationships

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode`
   - Add Neo4j integration tech
   - Output to AGENTS.md

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, AGENTS.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Setup tasks first, then schema, then client

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations identified*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
