# Feature Specification: Neo4j Integration for Knowledge Graph

**Feature Branch**: `004-neo4j-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement Neo4j integration for knowledge graph. Set up Neo4j Community Edition locally, create schema for C4 modeling and relationships."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on ContextFlow, I need Neo4j to be set up locally so that I can store and query knowledge graph data for C4 modeling, enabling me to build relationships between projects, services, and technologies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Neo4j is not installed, **When** I run the setup script, **Then** Neo4j Community Edition is installed and running locally.
2. **Given** Neo4j is running, **When** I define a schema for C4 modeling, **Then** nodes and relationships for Context, Container, Component, and Code are created.
3. **Given** data is loaded into the graph, **When** I query relationships, **Then** I can retrieve connected entities like services and their technologies.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Neo4j port 7687 is already in use?
- How does system handle large graph data imports?
- What if Neo4j installation fails due to system requirements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST install Neo4j Community Edition locally
- **FR-002**: System MUST start Neo4j server on default port 7687
- **FR-003**: System MUST create schema for C4 modeling (Context, Container, Component, Code)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support creating relationships between entities
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow querying graph data via Cypher

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Context**: Represents system context, attributes: name, description
- **Container**: Represents containers, relationships: belongs_to Context
- **Component**: Represents components, relationships: belongs_to Container
- **Code**: Represents code elements, relationships: belongs_to Component
