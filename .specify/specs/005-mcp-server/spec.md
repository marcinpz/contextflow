# Feature Specification: MCP Server with Basic Tools

**Feature Branch**: `005-mcp-server`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build MCP server with basic tools. Implement MCP server using OpenAI Agents Python SDK with tools for graph queries and code search."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AI assistant using ContextFlow, I need an MCP server that provides tools for querying the knowledge graph and searching code, so that I can access rich project context and code relationships to provide better assistance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** MCP server is running, **When** I request available tools, **Then** I see graph query and code search tools.
2. **Given** Neo4j contains project data, **When** I query for project relationships, **Then** I receive structured graph data.
3. **Given** code is indexed, **When** I search for code patterns, **Then** I find relevant code locations and dependencies.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Neo4j is unavailable?
- How does the server handle large result sets?
- What if tool execution times out?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement MCP server protocol
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide tool for querying Neo4j graph data
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide tool for searching indexed code
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle connection to Neo4j database
- **FR-005**: System MUST support tool execution with proper error handling

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tool**: Represents an MCP tool with name, description, parameters
- **QueryResult**: Represents result of graph queries
- **SearchResult**: Represents result of code searches
